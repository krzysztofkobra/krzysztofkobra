# Hi! 👋

I'm [Szymon](https://www.linkedin.com/in/swydraa/), a 19-year-old developer based in Poland.

I build web apps, micro SaaS, and whatever else comes to mind.

## What I'm working on

My main project is **[AutoAnaliza](https://autoanaliza.pl)** - a platform for analyzing the Polish automotive market. It helps car dealers and buyers make smarter decisions with AI-powered valuations and market insights.

I also run **[noreno](https://noreno.pl)** where I build websites, mobile apps, and custom automations.

My tech stack includes React, Node.js, TypeScript, and Python. In my first job, I dabbled with C++ microcontrollers, but low-level programming wasn't for me. I've worked with automation tools like n8n and make.com - they're pretty cool

I've got some projects cooking, but most repos are private. The ones that make it here are either part of something bigger or just something that didn't make it.
